This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Pygments, for sytanx highlighting. It supports more than 100 languages. This example is in C++. All you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag: 

````markdown
```c++
code code code
```
````

Produces something like this: 


```c++
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	string myString;

	cout << "input a string: ";
	getline(cin, myString);
	int length = myString.length();
	
	char charArray = new char * [length];

	charArray = myString;
	for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
		cout << charArray[i] << " ";
	}
	
	return 0;
}
```

A "copy code button" is added to the top right of the code block, which is adapted from [Danny Guo's
post](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/how-to-add-copy-to-clipboard-buttons-to-code-blocks-in-hugo/).

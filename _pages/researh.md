### <b> Current PhD work
#### <b> Genetics changes in high tumor mutational burden tumors
 Tumors with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), which is composed of mainly passenger mutations that affect protein folding and stability, suffer from protein folding (PF) stress. This can in turn reduce tumor fitness. I am interested in using human genomics data to identify genes that can potentially alleviate the protein folding stress in order to maintain tumor growth and survival.

#### <b> Establishing novel protein folding stress mouse models
 Currently, there is no genetically engineered mouse models that imitate high TMB tumors. I am interested in establishing novel mouse models in order to assess the impacts of PF stres in cancer.

#### <b> Systematic investigation of tumor suppression and stress-dependent lethality under protein folding stress
 Some tuomor suppressor inactivation might be crucial in overcoming the protein folding stress. As well, the context-dependent essential genes could be promising therapeutic targets. I am interested in systematically investigate the functional impact of these genes.

### <b> Previosu work
My previous research was focused on the binding mechanism between a ubiquitin ligase and its substrate. This reveals a conserved strategy of how cells sense and alleviate reductive stress. The key players in this reductive tress response have been mutated frequently in cancer.

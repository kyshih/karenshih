### <b> Current PhD work </b><br><br>

#### <b> Genetics changes in high tumor mutational burden tumors </b><br>
 Tumors with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), which is composed of mainly passenger mutations that affect protein folding and stability, suffer from protein folding (PF) stress. This can in turn reduce tumor fitness. I am interested in using human genomics data to identify genes that can potentially alleviate the protein folding stress in order to maintain tumor growth and survival.<br><br>

#### <b> Establishing novel protein folding stress mouse models </b><br>
 Currently, there is no genetically engineered mouse models that imitate high TMB tumors. I am interested in establishing novel mouse models in order to assess the impacts of PF stress in cancer. <br><br>

#### <b> Systematic investigation of tumor suppression and stress-dependent lethality under protein folding stress </b><br>
 Some tuomor suppressor inactivation might be crucial in overcoming the PF stress. As well, the context-dependent essential genes could be promising therapeutic targets. I am interested in systematically investigate the functional impact of these genes. <br><br>

### <b> Previosu work </b><br>
My previous research was focused on the binding mechanism between a ubiquitin ligase and its substrate. This reveals a conserved strategy of how cells sense and alleviate reductive stress. The key players in this reductive stress response have been found mutated frequently in cancer. <br><br>
